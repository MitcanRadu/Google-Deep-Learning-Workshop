I learned how to use Deep Learning models in order to process images and to augment 
various sets of images. The aim of the project was to create a model that is capable to 
recognise and label an object from an image. The challenge in training the model was 
given by the dataset, because it contained some mislabeled images. For that I used 
Python, TensorFlow and notions of Linear Algebra.     


The project can be seen in file "starter_code.ipynb".
